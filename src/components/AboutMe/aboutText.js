        A 25 year old full-stack web developer raised in Honolulu, HI and currently I reside in Irvine, CA.
        I have a background in customer service and experience in marketing. Recently recieved a full-stack web developer
        certificate from the University of California Irvine Coding Bootcamp, a three month coding intensive with a  focus 
        in gaining core knowledge and skills in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Node Js, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Handelbars.js 
        and ReactJS. With no coding experience prior to taking the course I gained a new love and passion for coding that
        I never expected. I also have experience as a marketing directing a urban dance team where I managed social accounts and
        worked with other individuals choreographing preparing for dance competitions all around the west coast. 
        Other then coding I also have passions for Music, Gaming, Pop-Culture, Bartending, Anime, Art, and Fashion.
